Description: library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmyxattr) and a couple of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like open(O_SYNC)). 
 This has two side-effects: making software that writes data safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe..
